age=input("enter age")
total_years=90
total_months=12*90
total_weeks=52*int(total_years)
total_days=365*int(total_years)
completed_years=int(age)
completed_months=12*completed_years
completed_weeks=52*completed_years
completed_days=365*completed_years
rem_m=int(total_months-completed_months)
rem_w=int(total_weeks-completed_weeks)
rem_d=int(total_days-completed_days)
print(f"you have {rem_m} months , {rem_w} weeks , {rem_d} days left")
