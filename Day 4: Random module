# random funtion is used to generate random numbers between a range like random.randint(0,1) both including
# seed is a fix number with every random number 
# if we input the same seed number any times , the random number generated will be same in all times.
# here , random int number is being generated between 0 and 1 , if 0 print heads else tails
# for generating floating numbers randomly , random functin is used like random.random(0,1) 
# here , 0 will be included but not 1 and any floating number between 0 and 0.99999... will be genrated
